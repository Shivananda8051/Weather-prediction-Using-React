# Weather Prediction Website Using React üå¶Ô∏è

## Overview
This is a modern weather prediction application built with React. It fetches real-time weather data using a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and provides users with an intuitive interface to check weather conditions for any city.

## Features
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for weather information by city name.
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- **5-Day Forecast**: Provides a detailed forecast for the next five days.
- **Dynamic UI**: Updates the interface based on weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy).
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Allows users to toggle between themes.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building a dynamic, component-based user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling and animations.
- **Axios**: For making API calls to fetch weather data.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides real-time weather data.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   gh repo clone Shivananda8051/Weather-prediction-Using-React
   cd weather-prediction-react
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
